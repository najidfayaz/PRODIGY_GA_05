The objective is to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another using Neural Style Transfer.

---

Technique Used
- Neural Style Transfer (NST)
- Pre-trained VGG-19 CNN

---

Implementation
- Content and style images are processed
- Feature representations extracted using VGG-19
- Content and style losses are optimized
